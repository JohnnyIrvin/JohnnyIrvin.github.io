[JohnathanIrvin.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20220623181137/https://johnathanirvin.com/) commits [seppuku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seppuku). Now an [Isekai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isekai), the website is reborn.

Nearly [two forsaken years](https://github.com/JohnnyIrvin/Website/commit/57ac6c79681aa48db8398a7ad9e4ec680ce881f8) have passed since [JohnathanIrvin.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20220623181137/https://johnathanirvin.com/) received enhancements. The stagnant beast lacked honor. The creature of horror ignored the security bells. It cared not to provide value. Death was the only way to ensure [reincarnation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reincarnation).

Thrust forth the crisis of covid has sprung the [need for software engineers](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2022/03/23/hired-report-shows-the-tech-job-market-is-blazing-hot-salaries-rising-and-businesses-recruiting-remotely-to-keep-up-with-demand/?sh=1fcc607f3655). Elite [hackers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_Manifesto) must rise to defeat the [cybersecurity crisis](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rscottraynovich/2022/06/09/at-the-rsa-conference-jobs-still-key-to-the-cybersecurity-crisis/?sh=7f5d694d360c). An onslaught of recruiter messages bombarded Johnathan's LinkedIn. The site knew the stakes were high. Little did we know how desperate the industry was for talented engineers.

With a harness of experience, we set out to change the status quo.

## Beautification Warning

Blessed not with visual creativity, the engineer was not a designer. He was an engineer.

The engineer had heard, "Your design skills are laughable."

The engineer replied, "I'm not a designer. I'm an engineer."

"I want my website to be beautiful."

The engineer laughed, "I use frameworks like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/)."

[Minimalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism) [sycophants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sycophant) beware the following:

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/)
* [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
* [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/)
* [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
* [Vanilla JS](https://vanilla-js.com/) ü§î

## Bravado Justification

The <del>readers</del> stakeholders needed justification for the engineer's bravado.

The engineer summoned a [value proposition](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/valueproposition.asp) to justify the coming adventure.

He championed [three](https://www.businessinsider.com/using-the-power-of-three-to-your-marketing-advantage-2013-5?op=1) areas of value.

1. [Security](#dumpster-fire-security)
2. [Content](#value-add-content)
3. [Metrics](#stalking-metrics)

### Dumpster Fire (Security)

Security issues plagued the repository.

[Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) alerted the engineer daily.

The engineer provided the <del>hackers</del> stakeholders with a truncated warrant list.

| CVE | Severity | Description |
| ---- | ---------- | ----------- |
| [CVE-2021-3803](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3803) | 7.5 High | Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity |
| [CVE-2021-23341](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23341) | 7.5 High | Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoSI)
| [CVE-2022-0355](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-0355) | 7.5 High | Exposure of Sensitive Information |
| [CVE-2020-7788](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7788) | 7.3 High | Malicious INI file |

The [rabbit hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland) had only begun. An issue inside of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) led to the rise of these little devils popping up multiple times in different dependencies.

The [hydra](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hydra-Greek-mythology) needed to stop. The engineer had not the time to learn how to stop the beast in its [JavaScript](https://javascript.com/) landscape. The engineering effort would be better suited to [Python](https://www.python.org/).

The engineer emphasized protective measures benefits.

1. Avoid litigation.
2. Protect information.
3. Stabalize mental health.

The engineer's security alert stress traumatized him with constant anxiety.

### Value Add (Content)

The engineer navigated the lack-luster [site map](/sitemap.xml) to identify hidden treasures. There were no treasures in these catacombs.

The engineer had a single article -- [Hello World.](https://johnathanirvin.com/articles/2020/10/10/hello-world/)

The <del>wife</del> stakeholders flogged the engineer for not producing content. An epic conflict ensued. Nearly fired, The engineer agreed to:

1. Document experiments.
2. Produce "regular" content.
3. Make lists.

### Stalking (Metrics)

The [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/) spies were able to provide decent intelligence.

* Number of visitors
* Number of page views
* Country of origin
* Demographics
* Behavior

The engineer knew relying on Google Analytics required JavaScript and could be unreliable. A trained engineer demanded more.

* Page Requests
* A / B Tracking
* Page Load Time
* Users w/o JavaScript
* Suspicious Behavior
* Rate Limiting
* Errors

The engineer wanted to track unexpected behavior. The engineer needed to use the scientific method to deliver valuable features to the <del>clients</del> stakeholders.

New features take time to implement. The engineer would deliver more in the coming sprints.

## Heroic Engineering

The engineer has been in the industry for over a decade. If stakeholders identify feature loss, they will fire the engineer.

The stakeholders need assurances of the engineer's heroics.

The engineer created a list of functionality to keep the stakeholders out of his man cave.

| Feature | Description |
| ----------- | --------- |
| Favicon | Browser/bookmark image. |
| Navigation | Page links. |
| Social Media | Contact links. |
| Footer | Page's bottom. üòÇ |
| RSS Feed | Article subscription.  |
| Site Map | Treasure trove. ü§¶ |
| Analytics | Usage statistics. |
| Blog | Article list. ‚¨áÔ∏è |
| Article | Semi-cohesive thoughts. |

The engineer composed a fancy email to <del>management</del> stakeholders.

```
Hello Mr. Fancy Manager,

    I am pleased to supply you with features maintained in the new version of the site.

    Send concerns to üóë.

Thank you,

The engineer
```

The engineer's written proof reassured the <del>boss</del> stakeholders. The engineer took a break of thirty minutes to entertain the <del>children</del> stakeholders.

### Language Swap

The engineer agonized with [JavaScript](https://javascript.com/) to absorb the knowledge of [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/). The engineer cried nightly and lamented the loss of security. Harassed with notifications from Dependabot, security concerns forced the engineer to switch to [Python](https://www.python.org/).

The engineer drank [Death Wish](https://www.deathwishcoffee.com/). He cracked his knuckles and readied for several long weeks of smashing keys and criticizing himself.

The engineer drooled over the thought of eventually adding [PyScript](https://pyscript.net/). Not that this release would have it. Maybe next release.

The Python microframework, [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/), boasted simplicity and speed. The engineer was inspired to use it. Flask replaced a non-existent backend with a simple, fast, and secure web framework.

The engineer discovered [Starlite](https://github.com/starlite-api/starlite). Sorely disappointed, he lamented the community for its constant change. The engineer pushed forward despite a lack of motivation.

### Shorter Templates

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is a redundancy goblin. Goblins are to be slain with simplicity. The engineer called forth [PugJS](https://pugjs.org). The engineer began to double his productivity. Behold the goblin slaying power of PugJS:

| PugJS | HTML |
| ----------- | --------- |
| `.p` | `<p></p>` |
| `.h1` | `<h1></h1>` |
| `article.p` | `<article><p></p></article>` |
| `article#id1` | `<article id="id1"></article>` |


The engineer required a rendering engine for Flask to be able to render the PugJS templates. The engineer discovered [PyPugJs](https://github.com/kakulukia/pypugjs).

PyPugJS was implemented.

### Borrowing Layout

The engineer <del>stole</del> borrowed [the layout](https://web.archive.org/web/20220616163353/https://johnathanirvin.com/) of the original website. [The original code](https://github.com/JohnnyIrvin/Website/blob/3674a86d1abe6f7e6c899ef06972960a6468cf05/src/layouts/Default.vue) fruited a good base. Then with a little bit of creativity, the engineer <del>stole</del> borrowed more:

| Feature | "Borrowed" From |
| ----------- | --------- |
| Header | [BootStrap Headers](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/examples/headers/) |
| Body | [Original Code](https://github.com/JohnnyIrvin/Website/blob/3674a86d1abe6f7e6c899ef06972960a6468cf05/src/layouts/Default.vue) |
| Footer | [BootStrap Footers](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/examples/footers/) |

The engineer was ashamed of [hard coded scalable vector graphics](https://github.com/JohnnyIrvin/Website/blob/3674a86d1abe6f7e6c899ef06972960a6468cf05/src/layouts/Default.vue) ([SVGs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG)). The engineer <del>stole</del> borrowed icons from [bootstrap icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/):

* [Envelope](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/icons/envelope/)
* [Github](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/icons/github/)
* [Linkedin](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/icons/linkedin/)
* [Twitter](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/icons/twitter/)

### Keeping Old Pages

The <del>engineer</del> journalist lazily wrote a a single article, ['Hello World'](https://johnathanirvin.com/articles/2020/10/10/hello-world/). The engineer was saddened by the lack of content. Yet, <del>readers</del> stakeholders were not to lose previous content. Previous content used `article/<year>/<month>/<day>/<title>` routes. Previous content kept this information in the [front matter](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/front%20matters) of the article.

The engineer did not know of the term "front matter". The engineer <del>stole</del> borrowed ideas from [Gridsome's GitHub repository](https://github.com/gridsome/gridsome). Gridsome outsources its front matter parsing to [Gray Matter](https://graymatter.org/). A similar library must exist for Python.

The engineer googled `python front matter` and discovered [python-frontmatter](https://pypi.org/project/python-frontmatter/). The engineer was now able to parse the front matter of the article and use that to deliver the content.

## Other Changes

The journalist lived in the past. The journalist could no longer write for his sites, IGamePress and [EnomView](https://web.archive.org/web/20180728203526/https://enomview.com/). The journalist died.

The tagline removed journalist.

The researcher was born bright-eyed. The researcher examined all details closely. Experiments performed were recorded.

The tagline added the researcher.

## Next Sprint

The manager said "Enjoy the weekend! Next sprint will be here on Monday."

The engineer grunted and said "I'll be back on Monday!"
